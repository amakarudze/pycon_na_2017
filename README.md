# pycon_na_2017
A repository for my PyCon Namibia 2017 workshop on "Testing Your Django App". 

<strong>Testing Your Django App</strong>
<br>
This is an introductory workshop to testing in Django for beginners like myself.

This workshop is an interactive one and participants are expected to have a laptop/computer. The following packages are required:
<ul> 
<li>Python (preferrably 3.4 or greater) pre-installed</li>
<li>Django 1.10</li>
</ul>

<strong>Instructions for setting up a new Django project</strong>
<br>
If you are familiar with Python and Django, just create a new virtualenv, install Django and set up a new project called <strong>dummy</strong> and start a new app called <strong>dummy_site</strong>. 

If you are new to Python and Django, please follow the instructions for installation from here:
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_installation/ <br>
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_installation/

Instructions for setting up a new project can be found here: <br>
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_start_project/

If you are still new to Python and Django or coding in general, please be sure to stick to the names <strong>dummy</strong> and  <strong>dummy_site</strong> to avoid confusion with replacement of names in typing commands. 

You can download my slides from this repository as well. I will upload the code used in this tutorial after the workshop is over should you need to refer to it.

Once you are all set up then you are ready to follow through my tutorial!

So let's start testing our Django app!
